Vimwiki makes it very easy for you to create a personal wiki using the Vim text editor. A wiki is a collection of text documents linked together and formatted with wiki or markdown syntax that can be highlighted for readability using Vim's syntax highlighting feature.
</p>

<p>
With Vimwiki you can:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Organize notes and ideas

<li>
Manage todo-lists

<li>
Write documentation

<li>
Maintain a diary

<li>
Export your documents to HTML

</ul>
<p>
Getting started with Vimwiki is easy. Once installed, simply type vim (or nvim) on your terminal to launch Vim and then type &lt;Leader&gt;ww (the &lt;Leader key is \ by default) to create or open the index wiki file, the "top" page in your hierarchical collection of wiki pages. By default, this page will be located at ~/vimwiki/index.wiki.
</p>

<p>
We may add the following example lines to the document:
</p>

<div id="My knowledge base"><h1 id="My knowledge base" class="header"><a href="#My knowledge base">My knowledge base</a></h1></div>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="Tasks.html">Tasks</a> -- things to be done <em>yesterday</em>!!!

<li>
Project Gutenberg -- good books are power.

<li>
Scratchpad -- various temporary stuff.

</ul>
<p>
Next, we can move our cursor to the work 'Tasks' and press Enter. This will create a Vimwiki link by surrounding 'Tasks' with double square brackets. Pressing Enter a second time will generate a new blank buffer in Vim where you can input your tasks. After you add some tasks and save the new file, you can hit Backspace to jump back to the index document.
</p>

<p>
A vimwiki link can contain multiple words by entering Vim's "visual" mode (the "v" key, by default) and selecting the words to be linked. Once selected, press Enter. By continuing this way and creating sub pages with links to even more sub pages, we can create an unlimited number of neatly structured, interconnected documents to help you organize your notes, documentation, and tasks.
